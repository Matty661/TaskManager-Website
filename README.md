# COMP2110 Task Manager 2024

As part of your assignment submission, write notes about your implementation
in this file.

## Avi
Until now I have been trying to make a working widget in my own separate copy so a bunch of the work from that separate copy I have now added to the joint project.
- Created weeksum-widget.js
- Changed one of the widget blocks to implement my widget in main.js

- Created a small line saying today's date using "toLocaleDateString"

- FINALLY figured out to isolate the ToDo tasks being displayed as opposed to all tasks being displayed

- Created weeksum-card.js file to shrink down the size of the task cards being displayed in my widget to show only valid information

- Successfully created a widget that displays tasks from the ToDo board

- Tweaked some of the CSS temporarily before we can create a universal style guide for the entire webpage

## Matthew
word
- Changed styling to match the "style.css" file,
- Added "taskTimerWidget.js" -- for a timer as one of the widgets.
